What happens when you initialize a repository? 
	It creates a .git folder and a repository for storing your files?

Why do you need to do it?
	It creates a space to hold your versions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area gives us the ability to package files ready to add to a new version without committing a new version.  That way we can check the package before committing.
