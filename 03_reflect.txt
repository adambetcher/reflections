Lesson 3 reflections

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  You would want to use a remote repository when you are working with other people, multiple machines, 
  or you want protection from deata loss on your local machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?
  Pulling changes manually gives one the control to ignore work that others have posted on the repository 
  until one is ready for them.  Additionally always pulling might slow down git operations.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Forks create a related copy of an existing repository, 
  clones create an unrelated copy of an existing repository and 
  branches create a working copy of an existing commit.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  If you want to work offline for any reason, 
  you can compare what you are working on with the last known state of the remote 
  if you have it stored locally.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
  There are several ways to collaborate without using a version management system like GitHub.  
  They include, face to face communications, emailing, phone calls, IM and others.  
  Without a version management system it would be more difficult to collaborate
  especially when people have more than one thing to work on.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
  You want to make changes in a separate branch when you are 
  creating a new concept that you want to vett prior to commiting to the master branch.
