Lesson 3 reflections

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  You would want to use a remote repository when you are working with other people, multiple machines, 
  or you want protection from deata loss on your local machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?
  Pulling changes manually gives one the control to ignore work that others have posted on the repository 
  until one is ready for them.  Additionally always pulling might slow down git operations.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Forks create a related copy of an existing repository, 
  clones create an unrelated copy of an existing repository and 
  branches create a working copy of an existing commit.
